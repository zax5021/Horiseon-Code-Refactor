# Horiseon Code Refactor
-- Unit 1 Homework 1 -- Zack Campbell

## Description

Using starter code that is formatted correctly but uses all divs instead of semantic elements: refactor the code to use semantic elements properly (and make a couple of extra bug fixes). In doing so you can see why semantic elements are important as a lot of styling code needs to be repeated when each section needs to be called out individually rather than being able to style larger (multiple) sections at once. 

Also, creating image alts and website titles help with accessability, webcrawling etc.

## Installation

Not much to it as far as I can tell, the repository is public to feel free to grab any of the files or take a look at the finished product [here.](https://zax5021.github.io/Horiseon-Code-Refactor/)
